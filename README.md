        ## comparing DevOps vs. Platform Engineering.

DevOps and Platform Engineering both help teams deliver software faster, but they do it in different ways.

What is DevOps?
Goal: Make development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams work better together.

How? By automating tasks (like testing and deploying code) and encouraging teamwork.

Best for: Small to medium teams where everyone shares responsibility.

What is Platform Engineering?
Goal: Make life easier for developers by giving them ready-to-use tools.

How? By building an internal platform where developers can deploy code, manage infrastructure, and monitor apps without needing deep ops knowledge.

Best for: Big companies where managing everything manually is too complex.

DevOps focuses on teamwork between developers and operations, using automation (like CI/CD and IaC) to speed up software delivery. Tools include Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. Ownership is shared.

Platform Engineering builds internal tools (like IDPs) to help developers self-serve infrastructure and deployments. Tools include Backstage and Crossplane. A dedicated platform team manages it.


        ## the trending shift toward DevSecOps

As companies adopt cloud-native technologies and microservices, they face greater security challenges due to expanded vulnerability exposure. This has driven widespread adoption of DevSecOps - an approach that weaves security measures throughout the entire development lifecycle.

Unlike outdated methods where security was an afterthought, DevSecOps implements protective measures from the very beginning. Automated security scans, dependency reviews, and compliance checks become integral parts of the development workflow. This proactive approach identifies and resolves potential threats during the coding phase, preventing security issues from ever reaching live environments.

Beacuse of those requirements and dependancies DevSecOps role become as the essential and trending job role.
